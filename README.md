# Weather App

WeatherApp is a simple web application that allows users to search for weather information for various locations and save their favorite locations in local storage for quick access. Built with Next.js, the app uses a weather API to fetch current weather data and displays it to the user.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KodaAllison/weatherapp.git

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. Set up your API key: 
Replace yourAPIkey in the fetch call with your actual API key.

4. Run the development server:
    ```bash 
    npm run dev

Open the app: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
## Lessons Learned

From this project I got familiar with routing in Next JS aswell as using an API to fetch data. I also learned how local storage can be useful tool to store data and how to do this. I also improved my error handling skills.
